### Watch out- not glass friendly right now.

I took the code from the end of the tutorial day 12 and restarted from there.
* Material changes so far include...
  * the bird bobs up and down before you start tapping
  * smooth transitions between death/restart etc
  * some UI elements ("play" and "restart" buttons, a basic scoreboard)
  * flap/coin/death sounds are more equalized (still not perfect) plus a new falling sound
* Code is being reworked so we aren't repeating ourselves a lot and the math makes sense
